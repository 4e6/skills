"""Tooling for Open Knowledge Format (OKF) v0.1 bundles used as LLM-wikis.

Subcommands
-----------
  lint    Conformance (OKF v0.1 §9) plus link, orphan and index checks.
  stale   Git-derived staleness of concepts, and coverage gaps in the repo.
  index   Regenerate index.md files from concept frontmatter.

Everything the model cannot reliably eyeball lives here; everything requiring
judgement (what a concept should say) stays in SKILL.md.

Exit codes: 0 = clean, 1 = errors (or warnings under --strict), 2 = bad usage.
S004 coverage gaps are advisory — whether a gap deserves a page is a judgement
call — so `stale` reports them but they never affect the exit code.

# Paths that never warrant a wiki concept. Overridable via <bundle>/.okfignore.

# Deliberately NOT merged with the project's .gitignore, for two reasons:
#
#   1. It would be a no-op. Coverage runs over `git ls-files`, i.e. *tracked*
#      files. Anything .gitignore excludes was never added, so it is already
#      invisible here. That is why this list contains no node_modules/, dist/ or
#      .venv/ — those can never reach us. Every entry below is a file that is
#      normally committed.
#   2. It would be wrong. Git's rule is "tracked beats ignored": a file that was
#      committed and *later* added to .gitignore stays tracked, and git does not
#      ignore it. Applying .gitignore here would silently drop such a file from
#      the S004 coverage report — making the wiki look complete when it is not.
#
# Reimplementing .gitignore is also a trap: nested files, `!` negation ordering,
# core.excludesFile and .git/info/exclude. `git ls-files` already gets all of
# that right. Let it.
