description: Create and maintain an LLM-wiki — a durable, agent-readable knowledge base for a codebase, stored as an Open Knowledge Format (OKF v0.1) bundle of markdown + YAML frontmatter. Use when the user asks to "create a wiki", "set up an LLM-wiki", "start a knowledge base", "document this project", "sync/update the wiki", "is the wiki stale", "lint the wiki", "record this decision", "add an ADR", or asks a durable question the wiki should answer ("why do we do X", "what does Y mean here", "how do I deploy"). Also consider proactively when the user starts, scaffolds, or initializes a new project, and after any change that alters architecture, a decision, an invariant, a data model, or a third-party integration.

# LLM-wiki (Open Knowledge Format)

An **LLM-wiki** is a knowledge base an agent both writes and reads: durable facts
about a project distilled into small, cross-linked markdown pages. Unlike RAG,
the synthesis happens once, at ingest, and compounds.

**Open Knowledge Format (OKF)** is that pattern, specified. Google Cloud's OKF
v0.1 names "LLM 'wiki' repositories" as the practice it standardizes, so the
wiki *is* an OKF bundle: readable by any agent or human, diffable in git, no SDK.

Read [reference/okf-v0.1.md](reference/okf-v0.1.md) before writing any page. Read
[reference/concept-types.md](reference/concept-types.md) before choosing a `type`.

> **Scope note.** This skill is version-controlled in the `claude-skills` repo but
> symlinked into `~/.claude/skills/llm-wiki`, so it loads globally and operates on
> whatever project you are in. Always invoke the script by absolute path (see
> [Scripts](#scripts)) — `$PWD` is the target project, not here.

## The half-life rule

This is the single decision that determines whether the wiki is an asset or a
liability. **Store only what the code and git history cannot already say.**

A page that restates a function signature is wrong within a week and actively
harms the reader, because now two sources disagree. A page that records *why the
signature is that shape* stays true for years.

Rank every candidate fact by half-life. Write the top half; refuse the bottom:

| Write | Never write |
|---|---|
| Why a decision was made, what was rejected, what it cost | Function/class signatures, parameter lists |
| Invariants and the consequence of violating them | File trees, directory listings, line numbers |
| Domain vocabulary as *this project* uses it | Anything `git log` answers ("added in v2") |
| Module responsibility, boundaries, and why it is shaped so | Restated code comments |
| Gotchas, sharp edges, "we tried that, it failed" | Step-by-step code walkthroughs |
| Operational playbooks and their verification steps | Dependency version numbers |
| Third-party quirks discovered the hard way | Content already in the *project's* `CLAUDE.md` |
| What is still unknown (`Open Question`) | Speculation stated as fact |

When unsure, apply the test: *would this page still be correct after a big
refactor that preserved behaviour?* If no, it belongs in the code.

The rule governs **admission**. Retirement runs on a different axis: does the
page record an *event* or a *state of the world*? A `Decision` is an event — "in
2024 we chose X, having rejected Y" stays true forever, including long after you
stop doing X, which is why decisions supersede and never delete. Every other
type asserts how the world currently *is*; when the world moves, those pages do
not go out of date, they become **false**. Retire them — see A6.

## The three layers (L0 / L1 / L2)

Progressive disclosure (§6) works because knowledge is stored at three
resolutions. Always know which one you are writing or reading:

| Layer | Lives in | Size | Read when |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L0** — abstract | `description:` frontmatter, surfaced in `index.md` | ≤250 chars | scanning for relevance |
| **L1** — the page | the concept body | a screen | the page looks relevant |
| **L2** — ground truth | the code itself, reached via `sources:` | unbounded | you need specifics |

**L0 is a budget, not a sentence count.** Every index entry is read on the way
to any single page, so its cost is paid by every query rather than by the one
query it answers — which makes length the thing to hold, and full stops a poor
proxy for it. A rambling 250-character single sentence is worse than two crisp
eighty-character ones. `lint` warns above 250 (`W017`), and warns *below* 40 as
well: a description that short is usually a stub, or a line YAML truncated at an
unquoted `#`, which is silent and looks like nothing at all. When a page will not
fit the budget, that is the signal its detail belongs in the body.

**The wiki is L0 and L1 only; it never becomes L2.** The code is already a
perfect copy of itself, so a page that reproduces it creates a second source of
truth that begins rotting immediately. This is the half-life rule restated
structurally, and it is also the sync strategy: L1 carries *why* and *what must
hold*, which survives the refactors that invalidate L2, so most staleness never
arises.

## Layout

The bundle lives **inside the project repo**, committed with the code. That is
what lets a single commit change behaviour and the knowledge about it together.

```
<project>/
├── CLAUDE.md            # points at the wiki (see A5) — this is the read path
└── wiki/                # the OKF bundle root (some projects use .wiki/)
    ├── CLAUDE.md        # how to edit this bundle — loads on demand (see A5)
    ├── AGENTS.md        # the same, for agents that do not read CLAUDE.md
    ├── index.md         # okf_version: "0.1"; the only index with frontmatter
    ├── log.md           # newest-first, ISO-dated change history
    ├── overview.md      # type: Overview
    ├── .okfignore       # optional; gitignore syntax; tunes coverage reporting
    ├── architecture/    # type: Module
    ├── decisions/       # type: Decision  (NNNN-slug.md, never renumbered)
    ├── domain/          # type: Glossary Term | Data Model
    ├── invariants/      # type: Invariant
    ├── conventions/     # type: Convention
    ├── playbooks/       # type: Playbook
    ├── integrations/    # type: Integration
    ├── gotchas/         # type: Gotcha
    ├── questions/       # type: Open Question
    └── references/      # type: Reference (mirrored external material)
```

Create directories lazily — only when a real page needs one. An empty
`gotchas/` teaches nothing.

`CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md` and `AGENTS.md` are instructions rather than
knowledge, so `okf.py` ignores them at every level and in any case: never
concepts, never indexed, never stale. With `index.md` and `log.md` that is the
whole exempt list — every other `.md` in a bundle is a concept, and a stray notes
file will be linted as a page missing its `type`.

## Frontmatter contract

OKF requires **only `type`** (§4.1). Everything else is recommended or a
producer extension. Use these, and nothing else, so the scripts can reason:

```yaml
---
type: Module                    # REQUIRED. From reference/concept-types.md.
title: Auth                     # recommended
description: One or two.        # recommended — this is L0, ≤250 chars; indexes reuse it verbatim
tags: [auth]                    # recommended
timestamp: 2026-07-10T09:00:00Z # recommended — last *meaningful* change
resource: https://…             # only if a canonical external asset exists
# --- producer extensions this skill defines ---
sources: [src/auth/**]          # repo-relative gitignore-syntax globs — the page's L2
source_commit: 4f2a1c9e…        # commit at which `sources` was last actually read
status: accepted                # Decision / Open Question only
superseded_by: /decisions/0009-mtls.md
amends: [0004-tokens.md]        # Decision only — the pages this one revises in part
amended_by: [0009-mtls.md]      # the mirror, on the revised page. `status: amended`
---
```

The bundle may also hold `CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md` and `AGENTS.md`, which
carry no frontmatter and are not concepts. That is a **deviation from OKF §3.1**,
not an extension of it, and it is written down in
[reference/okf-v0.1.md](reference/okf-v0.1.md) beside the clause it breaks.

`sources` + `source_commit` are the entire sync mechanism. A page with `sources`
can be checked against git; a page without them (a `Gotcha`, a `Glossary Term`)
is timeless and is never reported stale. **Only add `sources` to a page whose
truth actually depends on that code.** Over-tagging manufactures false staleness.

Link with plain markdown, bundle-absolute: `[auth](/architecture/auth.md)`.
Not `[[wikilinks]]` — OKF §5. Broken links are legal (§5.3), so linking a page
you intend to write next is fine.

## Scripts

`$PWD` is the target project, so resolve both the script and the bundle
explicitly. Set once per session:

```bash
OKF=~/.claude/skills/llm-wiki/scripts   # symlink resolves fine
WIKI=wiki                               # check first — some projects use .wiki
```

`okf.py` needs a venv, created on first use from `requirements.txt` (same
convention as `weekly-meal-plan`; `.venv/` is gitignored). Create it only if
`"$OKF/.venv/bin/python"` is missing:

```bash
python3 -m venv "$OKF/.venv" && "$OKF/.venv/bin/pip" install -r "$OKF/requirements.txt"
```

Always invoke as `"$OKF/.venv/bin/python" "$OKF/okf.py"` — never a system Python.
It shells out to `git`, so run it from inside the target repo: `--bundle` resolves
against `$PWD` (defaulting to `wiki`, which is wrong for a `.wiki/` bundle — pass
it explicitly) and `--repo` defaults to the bundle's git root. All three
subcommands accept `--json`.

The split is deliberate: the script does what is mechanically checkable
(conformance, link graph, orphans, git diffs, index rendering). Every judgement
— what a page should say, whether a diff is cosmetic or semantic, whether a
coverage gap deserves a page — stays with the model.

## Operations

### A1 — Bootstrap a new wiki

1. Confirm with the user before creating anything. Ask what the project *is* if
   it isn't obvious; a wiki seeded from a misread is worse than none.
2. Explore the repo to find real subsystems. Do not mirror the directory tree —
   group by responsibility.
3. Write `$WIKI/index.md` (with `okf_version: "0.1"`), `$WIKI/overview.md`, and a
   *small* set of pages you can actually support: typically `overview.md`, one
   `Module` per genuine subsystem, and any `Decision` / `Gotcha` the user
   volunteers. **Ten good pages beat sixty generated ones.**
4. For pages with `sources`, set `source_commit` to `git rev-parse HEAD`.
5. Do A5 (wire up the read and write paths), then A4 (index + lint).
6. Seed `log.md` with a `**Initialization**` entry.

Never invent facts to fill a template. If you don't know why a decision was
made, write an `Open Question`, or ask the user — that is the wiki working as
intended.

### A2 — Ingest (add or extend knowledge)

Triggered by "document X", "record this decision", or by you noticing a durable
fact during other work.

1. Decide the `type` from [reference/concept-types.md](reference/concept-types.md).
   If nothing fits, it probably fails the half-life rule. **The Layout tree above
   is not a substitute**: it names every type and its directory, which is enough
   to choose wrongly. `Decision` is the one that gets over-applied.
2. Check for an existing page first — **update in place rather than adding a
   near-duplicate**. Two pages that disagree are the main failure mode of a wiki.
3. Write the page: a `description` inside L0's budget and a body that stops at L1.
   Prefer headings/lists/tables over prose (§4.2). Cite external claims under
   `# Citations` (§8).
4. Cross-link both ways: the new page links its neighbours, and at least one
   existing page links to it. An unlinked page is invisible (`W011`).
5. Set `timestamp` (`date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`) and, if it has `sources`,
   `source_commit`.
6. Run A4, append to `log.md`.

`Decision` pages are append-only. To reverse one, write a new ADR, set the old
page's `status: superseded` and `superseded_by:`, and leave its reasoning intact.
The record of a wrong decision is worth more than its deletion.

**Revising one in part is not reversing it.** Use `status: amended` and the
`amends`/`amended_by` pair, which `okf.py` treats differently on purpose: an
amended decision still governs, so `index` leaves it among the live pages where
`superseded` sinks it under *No longer current*. Marking a still-governing
decision `superseded` hides a live answer.

**That holds for a mis-filed one too**: a `Decision` that turns out to record no
fork is still a page somebody has read and linked, so correct it in place — the
way a decision overtaken by events is corrected — rather than removing it. The
exception is narrow and is about your own working copy: a page you added and have
not merged, you may simply take back out. Not for free either, since every
inbound link and every page edited to point at it comes back out with it — a cost
paid when the page was written, which is the argument for choosing the type
first. (This is the one removal `decisions/` allows; A6's *retire* covers every
other type.)

### A3 — Sync with the code (the important one)

The wiki drifts silently. Run this on request ("sync the wiki", "is the wiki
stale?"), and proactively after landing a change that touched architecture, a
decision, an invariant, a data model, or an integration.

```bash
"$OKF/.venv/bin/python" "$OKF/okf.py" --bundle "$WIKI" stale --json
```

Then, per finding:

- **`S001` sources changed since `source_commit`** — read the actual diff before
  touching the page:
  ```bash
  git diff <source_commit>..HEAD -- <sources>
  ```
  Then classify, exactly as `update-dependencies` classifies submodule bumps:

  - **Cosmetic** — renames, formatting, comments, test-only edits, changes that
    preserve responsibility and boundaries. **Touch, don't rewrite:** bump
    `source_commit` to `HEAD`, leave the body and `timestamp` alone, add no log
    entry. The page was already correct.
  - **Semantic** — a boundary moved, a responsibility changed, an invariant was
    added or broken, a dependency appeared. **Rewrite** the affected sections,
    bump `timestamp` *and* `source_commit`, and append to `log.md`.

  Never bump `source_commit` without having read the diff. That is how a wiki
  silently starts lying.

- **`S002` uncommitted changes in sources** — sync describes committed history
  only. Report it and stop; there is no commit to record. Offer to proceed after
  the user commits.

- **`S003` `sources` but no `source_commit`** — backfill from the last commit
  that touched them: `git log -1 --format=%H -- <sources>`.

- **`S005` `sources` matches nothing** — the code it described is gone. This is
  the only retirement the script can detect; resolve it exactly as A6 does —
  rewrite, retire, or supersede.

- **`S006` `source_commit` unreachable or not an ancestor of HEAD** — history was
  rewritten (rebase, squash, amend), so the diff is meaningless. Re-review the
  page against HEAD from scratch, then re-pin.

- **`S004` coverage gap** — tracked code no page claims. Do **not** create one
  page per file. Ask whether the gap is a real subsystem worth a `Module`, or
  noise that belongs in `.okfignore`. Silence is a legitimate answer; not all
  code deserves knowledge.

Finish with A4. Show the user the wiki diff. **Never auto-commit** — the wiki is
their voice, and a wrong page is worse than a missing one.

### A4 — Index & lint

Always run both, in this order, after any wiki edit:

```bash
"$OKF/.venv/bin/python" "$OKF/okf.py" --bundle "$WIKI" index --write
"$OKF/.venv/bin/python" "$OKF/okf.py" --bundle "$WIKI" lint
```

`index` regenerates every `index.md` from concept frontmatter (grouping by
`type`, entries reusing each page's L0), preserving hand-written descriptions it
cannot derive. An `index.md` containing `<!-- okf:manual -->` is left untouched.

`lint` enforces OKF §9 conformance (`E…`) and reports rot (`W…`): broken links,
orphans, concepts missing from their index, directories with no index, absent
`description`/`timestamp`, and `W018` — a concept hidden behind an instruction
file's name (A5). Errors mean the bundle is non-conformant — fix them.
Warnings are judgement: `W010` on a deliberate forward reference is fine.

### A5 — Wire up the read and write paths

Three files, doing two different jobs. Run it on bootstrap, and on any existing
bundle that predates it — **but on an existing bundle, check for a collision
first**: a page already named `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` stops being a concept
the moment these rules apply to it. `okf.py lint` names them (`W018`), and
[reference/bundle-instructions.md](reference/bundle-instructions.md) opens with
the check.

#### The read path: the project's `CLAUDE.md`

A wiki nobody opens is a liability. Add to the **project's** `CLAUDE.md` (create
it if absent), matching the bundle's actual directory name:

```markdown
## Project knowledge

Durable knowledge about this project — architecture boundaries, decisions and
their rationale, invariants, domain vocabulary, gotchas — lives in an OKF
knowledge bundle at [wiki/](wiki/). **Start at [wiki/index.md](wiki/index.md)**
and drill down; don't read the whole bundle.

Wiki updates land in the same commit as the change, never as a follow-up.
```

**Write it to the project's `CLAUDE.md`, never to `~/CLAUDE.md`.** A copy in the
home directory says *this project* while applying to every project opened on that
machine, including the ones with no bundle at all — and it hard-codes one
bundle's directory name into all of them.

That last sentence is the highest-leverage sync mechanism in this skill — same
commit, same review, no drift. **Keep the snippet to those two things**, the read
path and that rule. A trigger list in it — *a boundary, a decision, an
invariant…* — only duplicates this skill's own `description`, and the word
*decision* sitting in it reads as naming a destination rather than an occasion;
which section a page belongs in is
[reference/concept-types.md](reference/concept-types.md)'s job.

#### The write path: `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` **inside** the bundle

The read path tells an agent the wiki exists. It does not reach the agent that is
already editing a page — one asked to fix a stale sentence, or landing a wiki
update beside a code change. That agent needs the frontmatter contract, the
concept types and the index/lint steps, and has no reason to know this skill
carries them.

Two files in the bundle close most of that gap, because Claude Code loads a
nested `CLAUDE.md` on demand when it reads any file at or below that directory:
the rules arrive with the directory, and cost nothing until something touches it.
**Both templates, the collision check that must precede them, and the limits of
what they reach are in
[reference/bundle-instructions.md](reference/bundle-instructions.md)** — read it
when running A5, and not otherwise.

It is a nudge and not a gate: only a `PreToolUse` hook can actually refuse a
write. Offer one if the user wants enforcement — `Edit|Write`, an `if:` on the
bundle path, denying with a reason that names this skill. **Nothing tells a hook
which skills are loaded**, so "only until it is loaded" needs state the hook
keeps itself, such as a marker file keyed by `session_id`; without that it denies
every write and the design is the user's call, not this skill's. `SessionStart`
running `okf.py stale` is the cheaper half. Use the `update-config` skill to
install either, and **do not install hooks unprompted.**
Claude Code's `.claude/rules/` with `paths:` frontmatter fires on the same
trigger and is worth naming as the alternative; it lives outside the bundle, so
it does not travel with a copied one and does nothing for other hosts.

### A6 — Query

Answer from the wiki before reading code, walking the layers in order: load
`index.md` and scan L0, open the two or three L1 pages that matter, answer, and
cite them by path. Drop to L2 only when a page points you at code.

If the answer isn't there but was worth asking, that is an ingest signal: offer
to write it down (A2).

If a page contradicts the code — or the world, which git cannot see: a vendor
bug fixed, a service dropped, infrastructure migrated off — **reality wins**. A
page without `sources` is invisible to `stale` by construction, so an encounter
is the only signal there will ever be. Act on it rather than reading past it:

- **Rewrite** when it is partly true — usually because the code still carries the
  scar. A workaround for a bug since fixed is a live page, not a dead one: say
  the workaround can now be removed.
- **Retire** when it is simply false: delete it, fix inbound links, log a
  `**Deprecation**` entry. Deletion is cheap — `git log` still has the page and
  `log.md` is the tombstone. A false page costs more than a missing one.
- **Supersede** for a `Decision`, never delete (A2).

Never retire on age alone. A three-year-old `Gotcha` that is still true is the
wiki working exactly as intended; only evidence retires a page.

## Gotchas

- `index.md` and `log.md` are **reserved** (§3.1) — never a concept. Only the
  **root** `index.md` may carry frontmatter (§6); `E004` catches the rest.
  `CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md` and `AGENTS.md` are skipped for a different
  reason — they are instructions, not knowledge (A5). Nothing else is exempt.
- `sources` globs are **gitignore syntax** matched against `git ls-files`, so
  untracked files are invisible to coverage. A bare directory expands to
  `dir/**`; any other slash-less pattern (`Makefile`, `*.sql`) expands to
  `**/pattern` so coverage and git-diff pathspecs agree.
- **Never merge the project's `.gitignore` into `.okfignore`.** Coverage sees
  only tracked files, so ignored ones are already excluded — and a file
  committed *before* being ignored stays tracked, so suppressing it would make
  the wiki look complete when it is not. Full argument in `okf.py`.
- **Submodules** are the exception to `dir/**` expansion. Git records a submodule
  as a single gitlink entry at its bare path and tracks none of its files in the
  parent, so `sources: [dep]` is matched exactly. A pointer bump then fires
  `S001` — the only thing about a submodule the parent repo can observe.
- Coverage ignores prose, dotfiles, tests, `docs/` and vendored trees by default.
  Override with `<bundle>/.okfignore`, which **replaces** the defaults rather
  than extending them.
- A page with no `sources` is never stale by construction. That is a feature —
  prefer timeless pages.
- Don't copy the *project's* `CLAUDE.md` content into concepts, or the repo tree
  into `architecture/`. Both create two sources of truth, which is the one thing a
  wiki must not do. The bundle's own `CLAUDE.md` is not that: it says how to edit
  the bundle and asserts nothing about the project.
